Machine Learning Library [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html) Guide
MLlib is Spark’s machine learning (ML) library. Its goal is to make practical machine learning scalable and easy. At a high level, it provides tools such as:

ML Algorithms: common learning algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering
Featurization: feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection
Pipelines: tools for constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML Pipelines
Persistence: saving and load algorithms, models, and Pipelines
Utilities: linear algebra, statistics, data handling, etc.
